# treato_dreams

This is a game called Treato Dreams created using pygame. 

While their human is at work, a dog has fallen asleep and is having a puppy dream that
they are in the park and yummy treats and icky vegetables are falling from the sky.

The object of the game is to eat treats while avoiding vegetables.

Rules:

• Each treat eaten increases the player score by (50 * level)
• Each vegetable eaten decreases player lives by 1
• The player starts with 3 lives
• On Level 1, 4 treats spawn and increment by 2 per level
• On Level 1, 4 vegetables spawn and increment by 3 per level
• After all food objects have been eaten or fallen off the screen, the player advances to the next level
• Between a score of 5,000 and 50,000 inclusive, every 5,000 the player will receive an extra life
    • eg: 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 and on
• If all lives are lost, the player loses the game
